# MXHX Source Resolver

Using a document tree generated by [mxhx-parser](https://github.com/mxhx-dev/mxhx-parser), and Haxe source code parsed by [haxeparser](https://github.com/HaxeCheckstyle/haxeparser), resolves the symbols that the XML tags, attributes, and text represent.

## Minimum Requirements

- Haxe 4.2.5

## Installation

This library is not yet available on Haxelib, so you'll need to install it from Github.

```sh
haxelib git mxhx-source-resolver https://github.com/mxhx-dev/mxhx-source-resolver.git
```

## Project Configuration

After installing the library above, add it to your Haxe _.hxml_ file.

```hxml
--library mxhx-source-resolver
```

For Lime and OpenFL, add it to your _project.xml_ file.

```xml
<haxelib name="mxhx-source-resolver" />
```
